## Topics

The course covers the following priors and models:

- **Sparsity**: L1 norm, L0 norm (Most of the algorithms are based on this prior).

- **Self-similarity**: Non local means, K-SVD, BM3D.

- **Robust fitting**: RANSAC, MSAC, LMedS (Multimodel fitting as Consequence).

## Implementation

The algorithms are implemented in Python.
